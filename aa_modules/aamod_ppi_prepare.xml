            Create PPI variables for use as regressors in a subsequent GLM

            The required <PPI> fields are defined as follows

               name - a name for the PPI (ex: V2x(Att-NoAtt))
               voiname - a VOI name defined in an instance of aamod_vois_extract appearing previously in the tasklist
               contrastspec - the contrast used to define the PPI regressors. This can be one of the following:

                  1) a contrast vector (e.g, [0.5 0.5 -1]) - NB: the vector is right-zero-padded as needed
                  2) the name of a contrast defined using aas_addcontrast in the userscript
                  3) a contrast specification in the form [weight]x[regressorname] (e.g., "+1xatt|-1xnoatt")

            Notes

            1) "name" is used in various files created by the module that contain the PPI regressor definitions.
            Be aware aa will strip any special characters in the name string you provide that interact poorly 
            with the operating system when appearing in a filename such as "(", "-", ")" and so forth.
            If you examine the module directory contents when the analysis has finished you may notice 
            the output filenames differ slightly from the name you provided. 

            2) the module saves a QA jpeg of the three regressors created (cf. Fig 36.13 in the SPM12 manual)
            in the file "diagnostic_aamod_ppi_prepare_<name>_00x.jpg".
