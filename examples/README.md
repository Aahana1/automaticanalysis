# Example user scripts and task lists

This directory contains example scripts that use publicly available data (either BIDS or Cusack lab).

The tutorials will help you get started with aa, and require only aa and SPM.

The examples in the demos and cbu directories show more extended use cases. Additional requirements of the specific analyses are listed in the scripts.
