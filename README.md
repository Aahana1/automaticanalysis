Automatic Analysis (_aa_) software was originally developed by Dr Rhodri Cusack
for supporting research at the MRC Cognition and Brain Science Unit. It
is made available to the academic community in the hope that it may
prove useful.

# About

aa is a pipeline system for neuroimaging written primarily in Matlab. It
supports SPM 12, as well as selected functions from other software packages 
(e.g., FSL, Freesurfer). The goal is to facilitate automatic, flexible, and 
replicable neuroimaging analyses through a comprehensive pipeline system.

More information can be found on the [_aa_ website](http://automaticanalysis.github.io).

# Help and support

Please feel free to open a discusion thread or an issue here on GitHub if you want to make comment or suggestions or are having trouble getting _aa_ to work.

# Software updates

The master branch on github is only updated after testing, so this version is the one to use. Developer versions are maintained in each developer's _aa_ fork on GitHub.
