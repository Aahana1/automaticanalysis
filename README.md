Automatic Analysis (_aa_) is a pipeline system for neuroimaging written primarily in Matlab. It supports SPM 12, as well as selected functions from other software packages  (e.g., FSL, Freesurfer). The goal is to facilitate automatic, flexible, and  replicable neuroimaging analyses through a comprehensive pipeline system.

The software was originally developed by Dr Rhodri Cusack for supporting research at the MRC Cognition and Brain Science Unit. It is made available to the academic community in the hope that it may prove useful.
